# Snap Tag
<h3> What is it?</h3>
Snap Tag allows users to send pictures to each other - with a catch. 
Each picture sent is automatically tagged with 3 tags relevant to the content of the picture! 
The receiver is then challenged to repond with a picture that matches at least one of the 3 tags, thus 
returning the challenge with one of his own.

<h3>Who was it made by?</h3>
Snap Tag is the achievement of 5 enthusiastic programmers over the course of 24 hours at DubHacks 2015 in Seattle, Washington.
